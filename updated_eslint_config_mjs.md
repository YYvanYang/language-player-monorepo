**Key Changes Explanation:**

1.  **`packages/eslint-config/package.json`**:
    *   Added `"type": "module"` to enable ESM syntax (`import`/`export`) in `.mjs` files.
    *   Changed `"main"` to `"index.mjs"`.
    *   Updated dependency versions (using latest compatible versions as of writing for ESLint 9). Added `globals`.

2.  **`packages/eslint-config/index.mjs`**:
    *   File renamed to `.mjs`.
    *   Uses `import` syntax for all dependencies.
    *   Uses `defineConfig` to wrap the entire configuration array.
    *   Consolidated the main configuration into a single object (index `[1]`).
        *   Defines `languageOptions`, `plugins`, and `settings` within this object.
        *   Uses the `extends` array property inside this object to include recommended configs from `eslintJs`, `reactPlugin`, `hooksPlugin`, `tailwindPlugin`, and `nextPlugin`.
        *   Custom rule overrides are defined *within the same object* after `extends`. This ensures they correctly override the base rules from the extended configs.
    *   **Important:** `tseslint.configs.recommended` is an *array*, so it's spread (`...tseslint.configs.recommended`) *within* the `defineConfig` arguments, *after* the main configuration object. This is the standard way to include config arrays alongside config objects in flat config.
    *   Uses `globals` package for standard environment globals (`browser`, `node`, `es2022`).

3.  **App Configs (`admin-panel`/`user-app`)**:
    *   These files remain largely the same structurally because they were already using `defineConfig`.
    *   They correctly import the shared configuration array (`eslintConfigRepo`) and spread it as the first argument to their `defineConfig` call.
    *   App-specific overrides are placed in subsequent configuration objects within `defineConfig`, ensuring they apply *after* the base configuration.

This revised structure aligns better with the latest ESLint flat config recommendations, using `defineConfig` and `extends` for improved clarity and type safety, while still correctly incorporating array-based configs like `tseslint.configs.recommended`.
